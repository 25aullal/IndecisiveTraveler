            <p>Avi Ullal</p> 
            <p>With 4 hours of experience, Avi brings incredibly mediocre design skills to the team. Avi also contributes his ability to try everything and be proficient in nothing. #UnhumblePeasant

            <p>Bera Gumruk</p>
            <p>With countless hours of trial and error, Bera brings questionable yet persistent web design skills to the team. Bera also contributes a relentless ability to break layouts, spend way too long on CSS adjustments, and still wonder why things donâ€™t align properly.

            <p>Ivan Chen</p>
            <p>Ivan is the kind of person whose intellect and insight naturally captivate any audience. His deep understanding of complex topics is matched only by his ability to articulate them in a way that feels both approachable and profoundly engaging. </p>

            <p>They call Kenneth the intelligence part of AI, because all of his work is natural. Beyond comprehension, Kenneth does not develop an AI super-chip in order to let others shine. #HumbleKing. </p>
